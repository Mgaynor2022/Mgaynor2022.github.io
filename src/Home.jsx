					Have you ever felt that you were filled with creativity but didnâ€™t know how to express that to the world?
					I felt that until I became a Full Stack Web Developer. The enjoyment I feel seeing my long hours of coding 
					and research come to life for the world to engage with is what I appreciate the most about Web Development. 
					I could be coding a simple text-based RPG game to a fully functioning web application, it gives me the same 
					fulfillment. My natural eagerness to learn new things, such as different software programs or techniques to 
					obtain the optimal solution, helps me overcome the problems I face as a Software Developer.</p>
